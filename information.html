                <p>Please note: seating is randomly chosen, you will not know your seat until after the purchase.</p>

                <p>The Longwood Lions Arena has 3,500 seats. However, because the arena is in such high demand, weâ€™ve limited seating to 3 seats per family.</p>
                <p>Once the arena settles down, we will up the number of seats to 5 per family. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
